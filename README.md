# Japan Life Quality By Prefectures

### What it is ?

This is a web-scrapping bot that uses puppeteer JS to scrape data about life quality by prefectures in Japan üáØüáµ‚ò∫Ô∏è <br>
Everything is then stored in JSON file so that you can easily use it in any code or software that you want. <br>
Here is a [web app](https://nihonlifequality.web.app/) I made with this bot ranking each prefecture's quality of life.<br>
Who know maybe you will find in which prefecture you want to move in !
